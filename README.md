# E-Commerce API - NestJS

## Overview

This is an E-Commerce API built with NestJS. It provides endpoints for user authentication, product management, order processing, payment integration, and more. The API supports features like CRUD operations for products, cart management, order history, and payment integration with third-party services like Stripe or PayPal.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication and authorization.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin and customer roles with different access permissions.
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for managing products and categories.
- **Cart & Order Management**: Customers can add items to a cart, place orders, and track order history.
- **Payment Integration**: Integration with Stripe or PayPal for processing payments.
- **Search & Filters**: Advanced product search and filtering.
- **Swagger API Documentation**: Interactive documentation for all API endpoints.
- **File Upload**: Upload product images and manage them.

## Technologies

- **NestJS** - Framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
- **TypeORM** - ORM for interacting with the database.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** - For secure authentication.
